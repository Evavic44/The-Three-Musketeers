## Contributing Guidelines🙌

This documentation contains a set of guidelines to help you during the contribution process. 
I'm happy to welcome all the contributions from anyone willing to add new scripts to this repository. Thank you for helping out and remember,
**no contribution is too small.**

## Steps to Contribute👩‍💻👨‍💻

Following are the steps to guide you:

* Step 1: Fork the repo and Go to your Git terminal and clone it on your machine.
* Step 2: Add a upstream link to main branch in your cloned repo
    ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Evavic44/The-Tree-Musketeers.git
    ```
* Step 3: Keep your cloned repo upto date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)
    ```
    git pull upstream main https://github.com/Evavic44/The-Tree-Musketeers.git
    ```
* Step 4: Create your feature branch (This is a necessary step, so don't skip it)
    ```
    git checkout -b <feature-name>
    ```
* Step 5: Commit all the changes (Write commit message as "Small Message")
    ```
    git commit -m "Write a meaningfull but small commit message"
    ```
* Step 6: Push the changes for review
    ```
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```
* Step 7: Create a PR on Github. (Don't just hit the create a pull request button, you must write a PR message to clarify why and what are you contributing)

**Note:**

> - Do not edit/delete someone else's code in this repository. You can only insert new files/folder in this repository.

> - Give a meaningful name to whatever file or folder you are adding.

## What should I keep in mind while contributing?💡
- When you are contributing, make sure that the work is entirely your own and not from some other source.
- All the scripts must follow [PEP 8 Style Guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
